# Blender Assets
A collection of Blender-powered visual effects (VFX), 3D models, scenes and other digital assets to enhance your next creative media project.
## Camera Rigs
**Camera Rig Pack:** This single .blend file contains three camera rigs organized within three distinct collections:
1. Animated 360° Path Camera
◦ Found under the *Camera1_PathFollow* collection. This rig uses an X or Y axis (but not both!)
constraint to animate a camera along a path around a tracked object (empty) in frame. It can be
manipulated using the Offset property under the Object Constraint Properties tab.
2. Dolly Rig Camera
◦ Found under the *Camera2_DollyRig* collection. This rig adds a dolly/crane UI to the scene based on
the addon (Add Camera Rigs) by Wayne Dixon, Brian Raschko, Kris Wittig, Damien Picard and
Flavio Perez. To use it select Pose under Dolly_Rig in the Camera2_DollyRig collection. Then select
and manipulate the UI elements as desired.
3. Animated Handheld Camera
◦ Found under the *Camera3_ShakyHandheld* collection. This camera uses a noise animation to add a
handheld-like shake to the camera. The exact movement can be customized using the Graph Editor.

## Explosions
**Explosion #4:** Large explosion simulation, complete with fire and smoke. Ready-for-rendering. Use *fSpy* to set the virtual camera to your scene and increase the frame rate proportionally for desired scale. Scene includes 82,500 particles with 5 emitters (a 150GB+ bake). Recommend enabling Adaptive Sampling for faster render times.
